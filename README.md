**Challenge**

1. Add a bar button item that lets users select from a handful of prewritten example scripts, shown using a `UIAlertController` â€“ at the very least your list should include the example we used in this project.

2. You're already receiving the URL of the site the user is on, so use `UserDefaults` to save the user's JavaScript for each site. You should convert the URL to a URL object in order to use its host property.

3. For something bigger, let users name their scripts, then select one to load using a `UITableView`.
